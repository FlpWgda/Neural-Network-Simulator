# Feedforward Neural Network Simulator

Web simulator presenting a learning process of small feedforward neural networks 
using backpropagation algorithm in solving the problem of function to data points approximation/curve fitting. 

Beacuse of CORS mechanism in most browsers local server is required to run the application locally.
